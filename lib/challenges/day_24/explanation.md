# Explanation

1. Take a list of integers as input.
2. Create a new list by copying values from the input list so the original list is not modified.
3. The outer loop picks one element at a time.
4. The inner loop compares the picked element with the remaining elements.
5. If the value at the outer index is greater than the value at the inner index, swap the values.
6. After all comparisons, return the sorted list.
