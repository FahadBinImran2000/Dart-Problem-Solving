# Day 19 – Find the Most Frequent Number in a List

## Problem
Write a Dart function that takes a list of integers and returns the **number that appears most frequently** in the list.

If multiple numbers have the same highest frequency, return **any one of them**.

The list will **not be empty**.

## Example
Input: [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3]  
Output: 1

Input: [5, 5, 6, 6, 7]  
Output: 5 or 6
