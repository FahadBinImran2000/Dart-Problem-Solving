# Day 26 – Find the Missing Number in a List

## Problem
Write a Dart function that takes a **list of integers** containing numbers from **1 to N**, where **one number is missing**, and returns the **missing number**.

### Rules
- The list contains numbers from **1 to N**
- **Exactly one number is missing**
- Numbers are **unique**
- The original list should **not be modified**
- Do **not** use sorting-based solutions

## Example

Input: [1, 2, 4, 5]  
Output: 3

Input: [2, 3, 1, 5]  
Output: 4
