# Day 16 – Reverse Each Word in a Sentence

## Problem
Write a Dart function that takes a sentence as input and returns a new sentence where **each word is reversed**, but the **word order remains the same**.

Words are separated by single spaces.

## Example
Input: "Flutter is fun"  
Output: "rettulF si nuf"
