# Day 27 – Check if Two Strings Are Anagrams

## Problem
Write a Dart function that takes **two strings** as input and checks whether they are **anagrams** of each other.

Two strings are called **anagrams** if they contain the **same characters in the same frequency**, but the **order of characters can be different**.

### Rules
- Comparison should be **case-sensitive**
- Do **not** use built-in sorting methods
- You may use loops and maps
- Strings will **not be empty**

## Example

Input: "listen", "silent"  
Output: true

Input: "hello", "world"  
Output: false

Input: "dart", "trad"  
Output: true
