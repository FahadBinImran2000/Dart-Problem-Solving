# Day 23 – Find the Longest Word in a Sentence

## Problem
Write a Dart function that takes a **sentence (string)** as input and returns the **longest word** in the sentence.

- If there are multiple words with the same maximum length, return **any one of them**.
- Words are separated by **spaces**.
- The sentence will **not be empty**.

## Example

Output: "development"

Input: "dart is fun"  
Output: "dart"

Input: "code well"  
Output: "code" or "well"
