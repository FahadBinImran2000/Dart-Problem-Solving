# Explanation

1. Take an integer list as input.
2. First, check if the list is empty. If it is empty, return 0 to avoid division by zero.
3. Create integer variables to store the sum and count.
4. Iterate through each number in the list and add it to the sum.
5. Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of elements in the list.
6. Iterate through the list again and check if each number is greater than the calculated average. If true, increment the count.
7. Return the count of numbers that are greater than the average.
